# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction & RFM Analysis

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using transactional data from an online retail store. The objective is to understand customer value using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and build a baseline predictive model related to customer churn and lifetime value.

The project is developed in the context of a non-contractual, continuous purchase business model such as retail and e-commerce.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains transaction-level data for a UK-based online retailer.
